# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project involved designing a web-based system for a company called DriverPass. The client wanted a system that would allow users to take online driving classes and schedule appointments for on-the-road training. 

# What did you do particularly well?

One aspect I think I did particularly well was considering the user's needs throughout the system design process.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would spend more time on the UML class diagram and include more attributes and methods.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

To interpret the user's needs, I carefully analyzed the project requirements and conducted user research to understand their expectations and pain points. I then translated these needs into system features, user interface design, and functional requirements. 

# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

In the future, I would focus on using the MVC pattern to create an adaptable system.
